Set up arrays for each line with stops on each
Determine the index number of the stop on it's given line
Check to see if the stops are on the same line
  If yes, return abs value of difference in index numbers
  If no, calculate absolute value of number of stop to Park on respective line
    Then sum that number

@mbta = MBTA::Subway::System.new
    @mbta.stops_between_stations('Red', 'Alewife','Red', 'South Station')
